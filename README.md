# Hello everybody! Welcome to my portfolio GitHub repository.

In this repository you can expect to find lots of source files including **HTML and Markdown files** that contain information about the website as well as the website's structure! There are also **CSS and image files** that are within other parts of the repo such as the resources folder and static folder!

This website contains my personal portfolio, or a draft of what is to become my personal portfolio. It is constructed with barebones HTML and CSS with some prospective vanilla JavaScript to be in included in the mix later. I hope you enjoy browsing around some of my _projects_ and _experiences_ to learn more about me!

You can access the rough draft of my portfolio here: https://wills-projects.github.io/!
