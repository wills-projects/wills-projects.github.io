            <h2>Virtual Machine Graphics Library</h2>
            <h3><i>C, QEMU, Linux, WinSCP</i></h3>
            <p>
              For this project, I developed a simple graphics library in C using
              strictly Linux system calls! This library ran in a virtual machine
              environment, specifically one called QEMU. The library used
              functions that manipulated a framebuffer for pixel-based graphics
              which is what you see in the drawing below!
            </p>
            <p>
              This project involved many elements, such as handling user input,
              drawing shapes, and utilizing specific system calls such as mmap()
              for efficient memory access.
