            <h3>Research Assistant (April 2023 - April 2024)</h3>
            <p>
              The Pitt Kids Thinking Lab is a group underneath the University of
              Pittsburgh. They are responsible for studying how cognitive
              abilities develop in children such as their mathematical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was able to work there as a research assistant during my
              freshman and sophomore year, doing data analysis and writing
              scripts!

            <h3>Hackathon Organizer (February 2025)</h3>
            <p>
              ScottyLabs is an organization affiliated with Carnegie Mellon
              University, and I had the pleasure of helping them organize the
              biggest hackathon in Pittsburgh.
            </p>
            <p>
              This opportunity involved coordinating sponsors with hackers,
              hosting workshops to enhance the experience of participants, and
              judging the final projects to award the prizes!
